/**
 <p>The Query API is for reading specific resources from Composable Commerce.
 The resources can be sorted and fetched in batches.</p>

 <p>First, you need to specify a query, for example:</p>

 {@include.example io.sphere.sdk.queries.QueryDemo#formulatingAQuery()}

 <p>Second, you use the sphere client to execute a query request, for example:</p>

 {@include.example io.sphere.sdk.queries.QueryDemo#executeQuery()}

 <p>The successful execution of a {@link io.sphere.sdk.queries.Query} results in {@link io.sphere.sdk.queries.PagedQueryResult} of a Composable Commerce resource or view.
 While the {@link io.sphere.sdk.queries.Query} interface just contains information to execute a query,
 the interface {@link io.sphere.sdk.queries.QueryDsl} also provides a domain specific language to tune a query.</p>

 <p>For most of the HTTP API resources, you can find classes to support you in formulating valid queries (in a sub package queries).</p>

 <p>The following snippet creates a query which selects all products without a specific order.</p>

 {@include.example io.sphere.sdk.meta.QueryDocumentationTest#queryForAllDemo()}

 <h3 id="creating-queries">Creating queries</h3>

  There are several ways to create a query:

  <ol>
      <li><a href="#create-query-with-model-companion-class">Create a query with helper methods from a model companion class</a></li>
      <li><a href="#create-query-with-predicates">Create a query with predicate API</a></li>
      <li><a href="#create-hard-coded-query">Create a hard coded query</a></li>
  </ol>

 <h4 id="create-query-with-model-companion-class">Create a query with helper methods from a model companion class</h4>

 <p>For some model interfaces companion classes exist (the name of the interface in plural) which provide some default queries, for example for categories:</p>

 {@include.example io.sphere.sdk.queries.QueryDemo#queryFromCompanionHelper()}


 <h4 id="create-query-with-predicates">Create a query with predicate API</h4>

 <p>There is a query model class for each queryable model interface, e.g., there is {@code io.sphere.sdk.categories.CategoryQueryModel} for {@code io.sphere.sdk.categories.Category}
, which contains a DSL to find and specify the queryable parameters.
 </p>

 {@include.example io.sphere.sdk.queries.QueryDemo#categoryQueryModel()}

 <p>The generic code looks verbose, but in the future it will enable powerful type-safe queries with IDE discovery even on deep
 nested data structures like products. (coming soon)</p>

 The {@link io.sphere.sdk.queries.QueryDsl} class, used by the query model classes, sorts by ID by default and it has no offset
 or limit specified. The following example shows how to specify sorting, limiting, and skipping pages.

 {@include.example io.sphere.sdk.queries.QueryDemo#withPagination()}

 {@link io.sphere.sdk.queries.QueryDsl} is an interface for immutable objects, so if you call {@code withXyz(value)}
 it returns a new immutable object:

 {@include.example io.sphere.sdk.queries.QueryDemo#immutableQueryDsl()}

 <h4 id="create-hard-coded-query">Create a hard coded query</h4>

 Since {@link io.sphere.sdk.queries.Query} is an interface you have the opportunity to code
 a query without the domain specific language:

 {@include.example io.sphere.sdk.categories.CategoryByNameQuery}

 <h3 id=predicates>Predicates</h3>

 <h4>Helper methods for common use cases</h4>

 <p>For most common product query use cases, like 'query by slug', helper methods exist as shown in the next example.</p>

 {@include.example io.sphere.sdk.meta.QueryDocumentationTest#queryBySlug()}

 You may have noticed that the type of the query is not {@link io.sphere.sdk.products.queries.ProductQuery} anymore but {@link io.sphere.sdk.queries.QueryDsl} which does not contain the method {@link io.sphere.sdk.products.queries.ProductQuery#bySlug(io.sphere.sdk.products.ProductProjectionType, java.util.Locale, String)}.
 That is due to the implementation of the domain specific language, but it still enables you to configure pagination and sorting.

 <p>Important to know is that the {@link io.sphere.sdk.queries.QueryDsl} uses immutable objects, so calling {@link io.sphere.sdk.products.queries.ProductQuery#bySlug(io.sphere.sdk.products.ProductProjectionType, java.util.Locale, String)} does not change the internal state of the {@link io.sphere.sdk.products.queries.ProductQuery}, but it creates a new {@link io.sphere.sdk.queries.QueryDsl} object with the selected predicate.</p>

 <h4>Self constructed predicates for special cases</h4>

<p>For more advanced queries you have to use the {@code Predicate API}. For example, for querying for names you can use:</p>

 {@include.example io.sphere.sdk.meta.QueryDocumentationTest#queryByNames()}

 <p>The Predicate API looks verbose, but it prevents you from making typos and it makes the queryable attributes discoverable in your IDE.</p>

 You can still create predicates from strings, but you need to escape characters.

 {@include.example io.sphere.sdk.meta.QueryDocumentationTest#testX()}

 <p>For creating predicates for resource &lt;RESOURCE&gt; there is a method {@code model()} in a class &lt;RESOURCE&gt;Query (e.g., Product has ProductQuery).</p>

 <h4>Connecting predicates</h4>

 <p>For connecting predicates use {@code Predicate#and(Predicate)} and {@code Predicate#or(Predicate)}.</p>


 <p>The following example shows a query for a product where either the name is "foo" <strong>{@code or}</strong> the id is "bar".</p>

 {@include.example io.sphere.sdk.meta.QueryDocumentationTest#predicateOrExample()}

 <p>To query for two conditions use the <strong>{@code and}</strong> operator. The following example queries for the name "foo" and the membership in a category with id "cat1".</p>

 {@include.example io.sphere.sdk.meta.QueryDocumentationTest#predicateAndExample()}

 <p>Since the previous queries have a common path you can combine the two queries in a <strong>{@code where}</strong> clause, like below. This is not supported for every resource, though.</p>

 {@include.example io.sphere.sdk.meta.QueryDocumentationTest#predicateAndWithWhereExample()}


 <h4>Negate predicates</h4>

Predicates can be negated by using {@link QueryPredicate#negate()}:

 {@include.example io.sphere.sdk.meta.QueryDocumentationTest#predicateNotExample()}

 For resources there is also the {@code m.not()} method which puts the negation at the beginning of the predicate:
 {@include.example io.sphere.sdk.meta.QueryDocumentationTest#notSyntax()}

 <h3 id=sorting>Sorting</h3>

 For paginated queries and consistent user visualization it makes sense to sort the search results. If you don't specify the sorting, results can appear in a random order.
 <p>Some implementations sort by ID by default, so even if you forget to specify any sorting options, the order of the results will be constant.</p>

 <p>To specify the sorting use {@link io.sphere.sdk.queries.QueryDsl#withSort(java.util.List)}.</p>
 The following example sorts by name in the English locale.

 {@include.example io.sphere.sdk.meta.QueryDocumentationTest#sortByName()}

 You can sort by multiple values, for example, for name sort ascending, and for ID sort descending:

 {@include.example io.sphere.sdk.meta.QueryDocumentationTest#sortByNameAscAndIdDesc()}

Like for predicates, you can traverse the query model tree in the same way to specify a tested and type-safe sort expression. But instead of providing values you use the {@code sort()} method.

 <p>If the SDK lacks of a method to create the sort expression, you can still provide it via a string:</p>

 {@include.example io.sphere.sdk.meta.QueryDocumentationTest#sortCreationByString()}

 <h3 id=pagination>Pagination</h3>

 <p>Assumption: in a product query all products are sorted by ID by default.</p>

 A query might produce more results than you want to consume or the system lets you consume. At the time of
 writing you can only fetch up to 500 objects at once.

 <p>Imagine you have 15 products:</p>

 <pre> 00 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 09 10 11 12 13 14 </pre>

 <p>And following query:</p>

 {@include.example io.sphere.sdk.meta.QueryDocumentationTest#queryAllExampleInPaginationContext()}

 <p>As long as you do not specify a limitation of how many resources should be fetched with one query
 by {@link io.sphere.sdk.queries.QueryDsl#withLimit(Long)}, the Composable Commerce API will deliver up to 20 items
 so that as a result all (15 products) will be loaded.</p>

 <p>If you specify a limit of 4 to a query as shown below, this query will only load the first 4 products:</p>
 {@include.example io.sphere.sdk.meta.QueryDocumentationTest#limitProductQueryTo4()}
<pre>|00 01 02 03|</pre>


 To load the next 4 products you need to define an offset by {@link io.sphere.sdk.queries.QueryDsl#withOffset(Long)}.

 {@include.example io.sphere.sdk.meta.QueryDocumentationTest#limitProductQueryTo4PlusOffset4()}
 <pre>|04 05 06 07|</pre>

 To fetch the products with the ID 08 to 11 you need an offset-parameter of 8.
 <p>If you use an offset of 2 and a limit of 4 you will fetch products 02, 03, 04, 05.</p>

 <pre>  00 01|02 03 04 05|06 07 08 09 10 11 12 13 14
 skip 2|limit of 4 | not fetched</pre>

 <p>The fetched result of a query will be a {@link io.sphere.sdk.queries.PagedQueryResult}.</p>

 <ul>
 <li>{@link io.sphere.sdk.queries.PagedQueryResult#getResults()} contains all fetched elements.</li>
 <li>The number of fetched elements can be obtained with {@code io.sphere.sdk.queries.PagedQueryResult#size()}.</li>
 <li>{@link io.sphere.sdk.queries.PagedQueryResult#getOffset()} corresponds to the offset of the query.</li>
 <li>{@link io.sphere.sdk.queries.PagedQueryResult#getTotal()} is the amount of resources matching the query but do not necessarily need to be included in the {@link io.sphere.sdk.queries.PagedQueryResult}.</li>
 </ul>

 <p>So, for this example query with offset 2 and limit 4, the {@link io.sphere.sdk.queries.PagedQueryResult} will have offset 2, size 4 and total 15. But be careful, count can be smaller than limit in some cases; for example, if total is smaller than the limit (limit 500 but only 15 products). It can also be the case when total is not dividable by limit and the last elements are fetched (.e.g. |12 13 14| with offset 12 and limit 4).</p>

 <h3 id=pagination-for-large-offsets>Pagination for large offsets</h3>

 Using big offsets can slow down the query and has an impact on other requests since the DB is busy with that expensive query.
 See <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/7228190">https://stackoverflow.com/a/7228190 for more information.</a>

 <p>For some cases, like iterating through a whole collection for imports/exports the offset parameter can be avoided by using a predicate id &gt; $lastId.</p>

 {@include.example io.sphere.sdk.products.queries.QueryAllIntegrationTest}

 <h3 id=reference-expansion>Reference expansion</h3>

 {@link ReferenceExpansionDocumentation The documentation for reference expansion have been moved to ReferenceExpansionDocumentation} since was also enabled for search and commands.
